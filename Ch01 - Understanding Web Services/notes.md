Web Services - Allow data sharing over the internet
Client sends message to server, web service performs action, web service sends message back to client.
Promote Reusability, Language Independence, Usability, Deployability

Main types are SOAP and RESTful.
SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol. Uses XML.
REST - Representational State Transfer. Uses HTTP.

Concerns - Latency (time delay) and Partial Failures (no responses).

Security is very important. Control who has read/write access.
Authentication -  Validating identity, usually with user credentials.
Authorization - Determines client's access level.

APIs - More streamlined than early web services.
