REST - Set of guidelines used to design APIs
Four API Principles - URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), Operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), Formats (HTML, XML, Text, etc), Stateless (server doesn't remember client requests).
Easy to create and use and lightweight.

Payload - Data sent between client and server.

HATEOAS - Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State. Clients interact with the REST API only through the responses of the server. Resources should be available through the publication of links.

See folder 02_04 for usage of a RESTful API in an iOS application.

POSTMAN - Useful program allowing you to test APIs. Can sent GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and save requests in collections.

See folder 02_06 for creating an API with Spring.

Swagger - Collection of tools for creating and using APIs using the OpenAPI specifications.
